# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques

Welcome! This project is my take on the classic [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on Kaggle. The goal? To build a machine learning model that can predict home sale prices as accurately as possible based on a wide range of features — from square footage to neighborhood.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the data and spotting key patterns  
- 🧹 **Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categoricals, scaling, etc.  
- 🏗 **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features that help the model perform better  
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Training multiple regression models (XGBoost, Ridge, Random Forest)  
- 🧪 **Evaluation**: Comparing models using MAE  
- 🛠 **Tuning**: Fine-tuning the best models to squeeze out extra performance  
- 📈 **Submission**: Generating predictions for Kaggle

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

This project uses:

- **Python**: the backbone of the project  
- **pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib**: for data wrangling and visualization  
- **scikit-learn**: for preprocessing and modeling  
- **XGBoost**: my go-to model for regression problems  
- **statsmodels**: for some statistical testing when needed
